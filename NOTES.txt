Setting pocket sphinx up:
Installing pocketsphinx via package manager is a great start point. For debian we can install libpocketsphinx-dev libsphinxbase-dev and python-pocketsphinx 

We also need python python-dev python-pip build-essential swig git libpulse-dev

We need the following to use the live speech method:
git clone --recursive https://github.com/bambocher/pocketsphinx-python
cd pocketsphinx-python
python setup.py install

Here is a good reference:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pocketsphinx
